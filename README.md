# Introduction

Java-based on-screen display (OSD) for keyboard and mouse events.

This program displays keyboard and mouse events for the purpose of screencasting. While such software already exists, none meet all the following criteria:

* custom display size;
* easily positioned;
* show single events;
* show all mouse clicks;
* show scrolling;
* accurate modifier key states; and
* works with emulation software (e.g., [Sikuli](http://sikulix.com/)).
