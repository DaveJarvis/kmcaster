# Introduction

Java-based on-screen display (OSD) for keyboard and mouse events.

This program captures keyboard and mouse events for the purpose of screencasting. While a plethora of software already exists, none meet all the following criteria:

* cross-platform;
* small display size;
* easily positioned;
* show single events;
* show all mouse clicks;
* show scrolling;
* release modifier keys when typing quickly;
* and traps emulation software (e.g., [Sikuli](http://sikulix.com/)).
